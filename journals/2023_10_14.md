- [tldr; Use linked references below as a todolist] *The Journals page also functions as an area to resurface notes. In the* ***linked references*** *of each day's Journals page you'll see the mentions of that day's date. This is handy for when you want to send your future self reminders or TODOs.* [it is clear that *linked refs* means "pages that link here, to this one"] **Each page has this *Linked references* section, showing all the blocks that point to that page:** https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/getting%20started%20with%20the%20journals%20page
- *When it's your first time using an outliner tool like Logseq, we recommend you write everything on the Journals page of that day.

To do this, add the following in the first block of the page Personal Knowledge Management: alias[two colons] PKM* and All else on https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/aliases%20and%20external%20links
